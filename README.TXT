No moles were harmed during the production of this game.
The lead character is fictitious and any similarity to other
moles or small rodents living or dead is purely coincidental.


Tech notes:
With a very few soundcards sound may be poor or not work, I will
hopefully release a DirectSound version soon which will fix that.

You can alter the gamma under options, but the default is
recommended as you lose colour definition otherwise (=bad shading)

When Molefest is run it will produce 2 files called molepref.bin
and molehisc.bin for saving prefs and hiscores. You can delete
these files to reset the prefs/scores. Always run Molefest from
the directory it is in (double clicking it's icon is fine).

Compatibility mode:
run molefest from it's directory like this:
molefest -fliptype3
this will only use 1 videopage, so no flicker on duff video drivers.


About:
Molefest is a puzzle game where you must lay down a 'path' for
a mole to follow using the pieces provided. The mole must move
over a certain number of pieces each level (shown in the top left
corner of the game screen) in order to advance to the next level.
You can learn it simply by playing, but here are the instructions:

You position pieces using either the mouse or arrow keys and
pressing the left button or enter or space to put the current piece
down. You can only drop a piece when the border of the square
you are over is white, you can change a piece put down that the
mole hasn't yet travelled over by clicking it, but there is a
time penalty during which you cannot place any blocks.
Cross blocks give an extra bonus if you travel over them twice.
You cannot alter a block already travelled over, or with a 'rock'.
Some levels start with pieces already in play. You can alter these
if you want. Altering any block incurs a time penalty and score
deduction.

If the mole reaches the end of the path and there are still some
squares to travel (see top left of game screen where it says 'Left:')
it's game over. When Left=0, the mole speeds up to turbo speed,
any blocks travelled over now will be worth many more points!
When the mole reaches the end of the path with Left=0, you advance
to the next level, but not before deductions for wasted blocks are
made.

That's about it. There are some secret bonuses for 'mole stunts',
and difficulty settings in the options menu make it easier/harder
with a related effect on scoring. Molefest remembers these settings,
so don't leave it on 'easy' thinking it's medium.

Tips:
If you can't think what to do with a block, get rid of it by putting
it in an unused corner.
The block you need will always appear within 8 pieces.
Use crosses.
Pay attention to the level names at the top at the start of each
level. I spent ages thinking them up...
